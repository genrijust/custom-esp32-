## Introduction
Designing a custom ESP32 board in Altium Designer gave me hands-on experience with advanced PCB concepts and tools. This post summarizes the steps and knowledge gained.

## Tools Used
- **Altium Designer** (PCB Design Software)
- **DigiKey Website** Find parts and their datasheets 
- **YouTube Tutorial:** Robert Feranec's YouTube tutorial:[How to Make Custom ESP32 Board in Altium Designer | Full Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWIzhbQaZZk)
  
## What I Did

- **Made my own symbols:** Read Data sheet Ensuring accurate pin mapping.I created new symbols.
- **Made footprints:** Used the Footprint Wizard to make shapes for simple components.pad shapes .3D shapes.
- **Linked schematic and PCB:** Connected my schematic to the PCB.synchronizing changes.
- **Used 4 layers:** Set up my board with 4 layers for better connections.
- **Changed rules:** Customized design rule priorities to control clearances, trace widths, and other PCB parameters suited to my design.
- **Did routing:** Drew tracks to connect everything.
- **Used differential pairs:** Made special rules for high-speed signal wires.
- **Drew polygons:** Added big copper areas for ground and power.

## What I Learned

- How to use Altium Designer for custom PCB work.
- Making symbols and footprints is easy with the wizard.
- Connecting schematic and PCB keeps everything organized.
- Using layers and polygons helps with power and signals.
- Rule settings are important for making a good board.

I’m excited to apply these skills to future designs!

Tips welcome!
